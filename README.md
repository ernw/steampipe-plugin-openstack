## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install ernw/openstack
```

Configure your [credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/ernw/openstack#credentials) and [config file](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/ernw/openstack#configuration).

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/openstack.spc`:

```hcl
connection "openstack" {
    plugin    = "ernw/openstack"

    # Authentication information
    identity_endpoint = "http://example.com/identity/v3"
    username = "admin"
    password = "changeme"
    domain_id = "default"
    project_id = "3e666015f769bf30cda73a1a1e9b794a"
}
```

Environment variables are also available as an alternate configuration method:

```bash
export OS_AUTH_URL="http://example.com/identity/v3"
export OS_USERNAME="admin"
export OS_PASSWORD="changeme"
export OS_DOMAIN_ID="default"
export OS_PROJECT_ID="3e666015f769bf30cda73a1a1e9b794a"
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  name,
  description,
  email,
  enabled
from
  openstack_user;
```

```
